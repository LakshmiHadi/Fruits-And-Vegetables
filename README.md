Fruits
Develop from the flower of a plant and contain seeds. Fruits can be classified into several groups, including:
Simple fruits: Grow from a single ovary of a single flowering plant, such as bananas, grapes, and tomatoes. They can be further classified as dry or fleshy, and dry fruits can be dehiscent or indehiscent.
Aggregate fruits: Grow from multiple ovaries of a single flower, such as strawberries.
Multiple fruits: Grow from many flowers packed together, such as pineapples, blackberries, and raspberries.
Other fruit groups: Include berries, pits, cores, citrus fruits, melons, and tropical fruits.
